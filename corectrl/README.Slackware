CoreCtrl uses a helper with root privileges to control your system. In order to start the helper, the system will ask you to enter your user password. 
If you want to avoid being asked every time for your password, you can grant root access to the helper permanently.

Make sure your username is in the users group in /etc/group!

Create the file /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/90-corectrl.rules with the following contents:

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if ((action.id == "org.corectrl.helper.init" ||
         action.id == "org.corectrl.helperkiller.init") &&
        subject.local == true &&
        subject.active == true &&
        subject.isInGroup("users")) {
            return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});


Currently, to have full control of your AMD GPU while using the amdgpu driver, you need to append the boot parameter amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff 
to your bootloader configuration and reboot.

For LILO users:

Append "amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff" to the append= line in /etc/lilo.configuration


If your system uses Grub, edit the file (as root) /etc/default/grub and append the parameter to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT:

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="<other_params>... amdgpu.ppfeaturemask=0xffffffff"

Then regenerate (as root) the bootloader configuration file with the command:
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

Reboot your system.
